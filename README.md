# Personal-Website-Redux

Say goodbye to the Wordpress theme that I have been using for my personal website: https://www.davidgailsmith.com. Here
I will be writing my own website that will blow that one out of the water. And when it is done, I will upload it to my
host so it can be reached at that URL. Until that day, you can check out the Github Pages deployment on the right to see
how its going. As of 10/21/23 I plan on using HTML5/CSS/Bootstrap/ThreeJs/jQuery/D3 and possibly some other tools.

The main concept is to have a ThreeJS sketch running that looks like a product showcase website. The "product" in this
case will be a machine that is comprised of procedurally-generated geometry". As the user pointd and scrolls, it will
rotate and move, with each components of the machine representing a different aspect of my creative skill set:  webDev,
CryptoNFT projects, painting, 3d fab, illustration, photography, generative art, and finally, credentials. When a
particular componenet is clocked, the cam will ease to a different 3d location, with floating cards that show case
projects in that category. The credentials page will be a d3 timeline with my employment history, and a layout of icons
with my skills, and a button to open or print a proper professional CV.

The site will be fully responsive and also have a non-animated sister site for those without an interest in the
animation.

The site will be compliant with accessibility standards.

The site will use analytics of some sort (not sure how to go about that just yet)

The site will use best practices for SEO to maximize its appearance on search engines.
